#summary Building the project from source.

To build the latest version of Cogwheel, you can check out the source and build it yourself using free tools. The software has been developed with Visual Studio 2008 in mind.

== Requirements ==

 * An SVN client (such as [http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/ TortoiseSVN]).
 * A C#3 compiler ([http://www.microsoft.com/express/vcsharp/ Visual C# 2008 Express] is ideal).
 * A C compiler ([http://www.microsoft.com/express/vc/ Visual C++ 2008 Express] is ideal).

== Details ==

  # Check out the code to a local working copy using the URL `http://cogwheel.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/`.
  # Open the solution file `emu2413\emu2413.sln` in VC++.
  # Build it once in Debug mode and once in Release mode. It should create the files `Cogwheel SlimDX\bin\Debug\emu2413.dll` and `Cogwheel SlimDX\bin\Release\emu2413.dll`.
  # Open the solution file `Cogwheel.sln` in VC#.
  # Set `Cogwheel SlimDX` as the startup project.

Hopefully by this point you should be able to build and run the project in either debug or release mode.
